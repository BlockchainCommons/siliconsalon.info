***What is the Silicon Salon?*** Currently, there are no semiconductors designed specifically for crypto-wallets, forcing wallet developers to cobble together solutions from what exists. Fortunately, thatâ€™s about to change, thanks to semiconductor manufacturers such as CrossBar and Tropic Square, who are seeking to directly address the cryptocurrency, digital identity & assets markets. 

The object of the Silicon Salons is to bring together these two groups: wallet developers and semiconductor manufacturers. By working together, we can ensure that the first generation of cryptographic semiconductors meets everyone's needs, advancing the entire cryptography industry.
