## Overview

Currently, there are no semiconductors designed specifically for crypto-wallets, forcing wallet manufacturers to cobble together solutions from what exists. Fortunately, thatâ€™s about to change, thanks to semiconductor manufacturers such as CrossBar and Tropic Square seeking to directly address the cryptocurrency,  digital identity & assets markets. 

The Silicon Salon drew together the community to discuss requirements in order to guide the direction of this new work and produce semiconductors that do exactly what the cryptocurrency market needs. It featured presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality, as well as discussion to allow everyone to have their say.

## Presentations

The first hour of the Silicon Salon featured [presentations](/presentations/) by experts in the silicon, hardware, software, and cryptography fields, including Christopher Allen, Bryan Bishop, CrossBar, Proxy, Tropic Square, and Libre-SOC.

## Chatham House Rules Apply

The Silicon Salon occured under the [Chatham House Rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule), meaning that information could be freely used by all participants and statements could be quoted, but not attributed. A goal of Blockchain Commons is to give principals in the Web3 and blockchain space the ability to discuss potential interoperability, but to do so in a safe way.
