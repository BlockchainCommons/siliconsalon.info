## Blockchain Commons

[Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com) advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure & compassionate digital infrastructure
To enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online. It does so by working with developer communities to design, build, and maintain that infrastructure; based on responsible key management; based on our Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness; and based on our Self-Sovereign Identity Principles. We also strive to educate & grow the blockchain community through online courses and our work with legislators and regulators.

Blockchain Commons is proudly a “not-for-profit” social benefit corporation, domiciled in Wyoming but operating world-wide. We have a strong commitment to open source and a defensive patent strategy: anyone can use or improve our tools, and no one can take them away.
