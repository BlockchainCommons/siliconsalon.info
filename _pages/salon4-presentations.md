    title: "Andrew Poelstra Presentation"
    excerpt: '**Anti-Exfil: Preventing Key Exfiltration Through Signature Nonce Data.** Secure nonce generation is critical to EC signature generation. If a hardware wallet fails to generate these nonces uniformly at random, then key leakage will occur. This talk introduces "anti-exfil", a two-round interactive  protocol for producing a signature.'

    title: "Luke Leighton & David Calderwood Presentation"
    excerpt: '**Scalar and Vector Draft Biginteger instructions for the Power ISA.** Most RISC ISAs are missing instructions that allow for easy chaining to create Vector results for biginteger operation. This presentation describes the need for 3-in 2-out instructions that greatly simplify biginteger operations as a key strategic requirement for semiconductor design.'

    excerpt: '**Pitfalls and Approaches to Open Source Security Semiconductor.** It&rsquo;s not straightforward to extend the open-source approach to security semiconductors. This talk describes some open-source history, explains Cramium&rsquo;s approach to navigating these problems, and provides at least some of the benefits of open source in the context of semiconductor design.'
