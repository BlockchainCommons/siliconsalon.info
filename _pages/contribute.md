{: .notice--success}

The Silicon Salon is continuing on a quarterly bases, and should appear around January, April, July, and October of this year.
These virtual salons are intended to bring together digital wallet developers, semiconductor manufacturers, and academics. The ultimate objective: to ensure that the next generation of cryptographic semiconductors meets everyoneâ€™s needs, advancing the entire cryptography industry. 

That only works if we have as many stakeholders as possible on hand to jointly discuss their requirements and their capabilities. So if you're producing semiconductors with an eye toward cryptography support, if you're working on digital-asset wallets, or if you're researching and publishing on cryptographic capabilities, we'd love to have you make a presentation at the next Silicon Salon.

Please mail us at [team@blockchaincommons.com](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com) and tell us about what you'd like to present. Your proposal should include:

1. The title of the presentation.
2. A summary of what your presentation will be about.
3. A summary of how this topic focuses on semiconductor capabilities, wallet requirements, or other related topics.
4. The name of the presenter(s). 
5. A description of who they are and how they or their company have the expertise, capability, or reach to benefit the Silicon Salon conversation.

Final presentations should be about five minutes long, supported by a slidedeck or some sort, which you will present in Zoom on the date of the salon.

Specific salons will focus on specific topics. If you've got something to say about the topic above for the upcoming salon, we'd particularly love to have you present! (But even if your preferred topic is more varied, let us know: we might include it, or we might focus the _next_ salon on that discussion.)
