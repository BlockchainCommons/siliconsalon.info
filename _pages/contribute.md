Silicon Salon 4 is planned for April ??, 2023. The main topics will be ????.
{: .notice--success}

The Silicon Salon is returning on a quarterly basis, with virtual workshops scheduled for January, April, July, and October of this year. We will be bringing together digital wallet developers, semiconductor manufacturers, and academics. Our ultimate objective: to ensure that the next generation of cryptographic semiconductors meets everyones' needs, advancing the entire cryptography industry. 

_We want you_ to make a presentation about your unique experiences in the field, whether you're producing semiconductors with an eye toward cryptography support, working on digital-asset wallets, or researching and publishing about cryptographic capabilities. We want to highlight cutting-edge research, innovative technologies, and real-world applications that are shaping the future of silicon-based security architectures. 

Here's some of our best presentations from the recent Silicon Salons:

Please mail us at [team@blockchaincommons.com](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com) and tell us about what you'd like to present. Your proposal should include:

* Cryptographic algorithms and protocols
* Digital asset security and privacy
* Semiconductor capabilities for cryptography
* Digital wallet requirements and design
* Blockchain security and scalability leveraging hardwared
* Post-quantum cryptography in silicon
* Cryptography in IoT and edge devices
* 
1. The title of the presentation.
2. A summary of what your presentation will be about.
3. A summary of how this topic focuses on semiconductor capabilities, wallet requirements, or other related topics.
4. The name of the presenter(s). 
5. A description of who they are and how they or their company have the expertise, capability, or reach to benefit the Silicon Salon conversation.

Final presentations should be about five minutes long, supported by a slidedeck or some sort, which you will present in Zoom on the date of the salon.

Specific salons will focus on specific topics. If you've got something to say about the topic above for the upcoming salon, we'd particularly love to have you present! (But even if your preferred topic is more varied, let us know: we might include it, or we might focus the _next_ salon on that discussion.)
